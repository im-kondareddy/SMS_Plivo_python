Changed the original auth_id and auth_token to continues "x" as the code will be in public repository.

SmsAccount is the class which contains the methods for completing the task given.

sms_account is the method for retrieving the current account total amount by providing the auth_id and auth_token.

Messages are sent in the method sms_send which takes three arguments (sorce mobile number, destination mobile number and the message) which returns message_uuid.
Used sleep method to wait till the message_uuid is generated which was taking 0.1 second for safer side 1 second sleep time has been used.

To get the message cost sms_status method is used, which takes one argument (message_uuid) and returns cost of the message sent.
Till the message is sent completely  message_state is checked and generating the total_amount will also takes some time, so used sleep method. This delay in getting the total_amount represented by printing dotted lines to indicate waiting for the response. Each of the dotted line indicates 6 seconds of delay.

Amount in the current account before sedning the message is printed then a message will be sent after that cost of the message is printed and at last total amount present in the current account after sending the message is printed.

Output looks like mentioned below.


Your Amount:  7.92624
